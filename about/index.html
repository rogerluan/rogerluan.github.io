But that changed later in life when I started reading a lot of technical articles and other interesting content. Then I realized I never really hated reading itself, just reading fiction books that we were forced to read in school. Who'd thought?</p><p>Over the course of years I realized I could help the tech community by writing about topics that were too hard to find information about. This website hosts those articles!</p><p>This website is currently a work in progress. There're many things still being built, such as better menus, proper tags, metadata, better syntax highlighting for programming posts, and just a better visual aspect.</p><h2>About Me</h2><p>I'm Roger Oba, and I run this site independently, during my free time. I’m passionate about iOS development, and have high UX standards (although web front end is definitely not my forte as you can see here 😂).</p><p>Lead Mobile Engineer @ <a href="https://www.tellusapp.com">Tellus</a> 🏡</p><p>Apple Developer Academy scholarship recipient 🍎</p><p>Core contributor @ <a href="https://fastlane.tools"><em>fastlane</em></a> 🚀</p><p>9+ years of mobile app development 👨‍💻</p><p>Yeah, I like emojis. 👻</p></div>
